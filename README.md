Hello World! My goal with coding is to give myself a shot at being an entrepreneur. With a background in sales, project management, and software engineering, I can take my ideas from a scratch piece of paper to a profitable business, all from my computer and phone. Our modern world has lowered the energy required to start a company and I want to take this an my opportunity to create cool products!
