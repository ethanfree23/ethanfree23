Welcome All! My goal with coding is to ultimately create applications that bring people closer to life, whether that is through saving them time, connecting with others, or exploring the beautiful world we are born into. I love the idea of being able to create my own applications, as well as use my skills to create a means of income, whether through my own entrepreneurial endeavors, or freelancing. Currently, I am working on an artwork as a service startup as well as a customer service portal for machine manufacturers.
