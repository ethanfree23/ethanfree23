Welcome All! I am so happy to finally be coding! Since starting roughly 6 months ago, I have learned React and Rails, along with Tailwind. I still have a lot to learn before I would consider myself a true developer, but committing myself to frequent improvement is the only path. My interests include business development (through a hyper-focus on customer success) and creating tools that help people earn money (gig economy). 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethanfree23
- 👀 I’m interested in entrepreneurship, software development, and helping people utilize tools to their highest level.
- 🌱 I’m currently seeking employment in full-stack development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help micro-entrepreneurs succeed more!
- 📫 How to reach me: ethanfree23@gmail.com -or- message me on GitHub.
